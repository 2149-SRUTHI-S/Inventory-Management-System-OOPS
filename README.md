# Inventory-Management-System-OOPS

This is the Usecase given in last year Mr.Cooper Long Programming Round.
This is the code which I have did and got selected!
But this is not the complete code, it also contains some errors.
So, just use this as reference!

If you want a complete running example of Long Programming Code, you can check out this repository (Bank Management System):
